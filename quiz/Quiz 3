The steps involved in science interference we there is a pyramid: first have prediction where a prediction is made bsed off the sceneario:quality of interest, Second we have validation + Scenario: validation data, third on the pyramid we colaboration & scenario: calibration data(S CAL) (D CAL). This breakdown to the simple three which are 
Three pillars of science are Observation, hypothesis testing and observation.
The three major applications of the thrid pillar of science callibration & scenario there is observation and the have two problems which are inverse and forward problems. the third pillar od science can replace the other two by the callbration of data, and the prediction of the data.
Deductive and Plausible reasoning. An example for deductive reasoning "if A is true than b is true""A" IS TRUE. An example for plausible reasoning "If a is true than b is true""B is true making a becone nore plausible".
No, for example "IF A IS expressed then b is only expressed as a logical consequence when the variable 'A' is not necessarily a causal consequence.
Boolean alegerba is named after George Boole 


used to denote the equal truth value 








This quiz was a bit confusing due to barely covering over the truth table, NAND logic and the ven diagrams is okay but kind of hard to incorporate as questions. So i feel like this quiz is a bit confusing and not fair the other quizzes are okay; I feel pressure when taking quizzes/tests i am not a great test/quiz taker. It's like I forget the content learned even if i do study!!!
